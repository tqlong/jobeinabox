 * This file defines the FileCache class, which manages the local file
 * cache. Files are stored in the /home/jobe/files subtree with file names
 * being the fileIDs supplied in the RestAPI 'put' requests. Normally these
 * are the MD5 hashes of the file contents. Files are stored in a 2 level
 * directory hierarchy like the Moodle file cache, with the first two letters of
 * the fileID specifying the top-level directory name and the next two letters
 * the second-level directory name. The rest of the fileID is used as the
 * linux file name.

     * if, before adding a file, the volume containing the file cache directory
     * (/home/jobe/files) is over 95% full.
     *
     * If Jobe is providing services just to a Moodle/CodeRunner instance, this
     * method should rarely if ever be called. Usually (and indeed always, prior
     * to 2019) the only files being uploaded are the support files attached to
     * questions by question authors. The total of all such files is usually small
     * enough to leave plenty of space in a typical Linux install.

     * However, if question authors are allowing/requiring students to attach
     * files to their submissions, the file cache could fill up over time and/or
     * with large classes and/or with large attachments. Then a cache clean up
     * will be required. However, it should still be a very rare event and is
     * certainly no worse than switching CodeRunner to a new Jobe server.
     *
     * Note that CodeRunner always tries running a job without first uploading
     * files. Only if the run fails with a 404 Not Found do the files then
     * get uploaded. With this mode of operation, deleting files unused for
     * 2 days should be safe. However, non-CodeRunner users using HEAD to
     * check file existence need to be prepared to re-upload files in the event
     * of a 404 Not Found.
